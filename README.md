Hey there 👋 glad you've stumbled upon my corner of GitHub. I'm just a guy who likes **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** development. My primary work has been in the field of genetic engineering and general biologcal data analysis, so that's most of what you'll find here. That being said, I hope to be making public some of my side projects soon!
