Hey there ðŸ‘‹ glad you've stumbled upon my corner of GitHub. I'm just a guy who likes **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence** development. My primary work has been in the field of genetic engineering and general biologcal data analysis, so that's most of what you'll find here. That being said, I hope to be making public some of my side projects soon!

## About Me:

- ðŸ’» I'm a PhD candidate in biochemistry with specializations in machine learning and scientific computing
- ðŸ¤– I enjoy working on projects that involve novel methologies, ML architectures, and transfer learning
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time I love the outdoors, volunteering as a medic, playing guitar, and Pathfinder 1e

Some of the things I tend to use...
